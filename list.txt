-epool 	Ethereum pool address. Only Stratum protocol is supported for pools. Miner supports all pools that are compatible with Dwarfpool proxy and accept Ethereum wallet address directly.
	For solo mining, specify "http://" before address, note that this mode is not intended for proxy or HTTP pools, also "-allpools 1" will be set automatically in this mode.
	Note: The miner supports all Stratum versions for Ethereum, HTTP mode is necessary for solo mining only. 
	Using any proxies will reduce effective hashrate by at least 1%, so connect miner to Stratum pools directly. Using HTTP pools will reduce effective hashrate by at least 5%.

-ewal 	Your Ethereum wallet address. Also worker name and other options if pool supports it. 
	Pools that require "Login.Worker" instead of wallet address are not supported directly currently, but you can use "allpools 1" option to mine there.

-epsw 	Password for Ethereum pool, use "x" as password.

-eworker Worker name, it is required for some pools.

-esm	Ethereum Stratum mode. 0 - eth-proxy mode (for example, dwarpool.com), 1 - qtminer mode (for example, ethpool.org), 
	2 - miner-proxy mode (for example, coinotron.com), 3 - nicehash mode. 0 is default. 

-etha	Ethereum algorithm mode for AMD cards. 0 - optimized for fast cards, 1 - optimized for slow cards, 2 - for gpu-pro Linux drivers. -1 - autodetect (default, automatically selects between 0 and 1). 
	You can also set this option for every card individually, for example "0,1,0".

-asm	(AMD cards only) enables assembler GPU kernels. In this mode some tuning is required even in ETH-only mode,
	Currently ETH-LBRY mode is not supported in assembler.
	Specify "-asm 0" to disable this option. You can also specify values for every card, for example "0,1,0". Default value is "1".
	If ASM mode is enabled, miner must show "GPU #x: algorithm ASM" at startup.
	Check "FINE-TUNING" section below for additional notes.
	NEW: added alternative assembler kernels for Tonga and Polaris cards for ETH-only mode.(i.e. you cannot find speed peak), use "2" option to enable this mode.

-ethi	Ethereum intensity. Default value is 8, you can decrease this value if you don't want Windows to freeze or if you have problems with stability. The most low GPU load is "0".
	now can set intensity for every card individually, for example "1,8,6".
	You can also specify negative values, for example, "-8192", it exactly means "global work size" parameter which is used in official miner.

-eres	this setting is related to Ethereum mining stability. Every next Ethereum epoch requires a bit more GPU memory, miner can crash during reallocating GPU buffer for new DAG. 
	To avoid it, miner reserves a bit larger GPU buffer at startup, so it can process several epochs without buffer reallocation.
	This setting defines how many epochs miner must foresee when it reserves GPU buffer, i.e. how many epochs will be processed without buffer reallocation. Default value is 2.

-allpools Specify "1" if miner does not want to mine on specified pool (because it cannot mine devfee on that pool), but you agree to use some default pools for devfee mining. 
	Note that if devfee mining pools will stop, entire mining will be stopped too.

-allcoins Specify "1" to be able to mine Ethereum forks, in this mode miner will use some default pools for devfee Ethereum mining. 
	Note that if devfee mining pools will stop, entire mining will be stopped too. 
	Miner has to use two DAGs in this mode - one for Ethereum and one for Ethereum fork, it can cause crashes because DAGs have different sizes. 
	Therefore for this mode it is recommended to specify current Ethereum epoch (or a bit larger value), 
	for example, "47" means that miner will expect DAG size for epoch #47 and will allocate appropriate GPU buffer at starting, instead of reallocating bigger GPU buffer (may crash) when it starts devfee mining.
	Another option is to specify "-1", in this mode miner will start devfee round immediately after start and therefore will get current epoch for Ethereum, after that it will be able to mine Ethereum fork.
	If you mine Expanse, the best way is to specify "exp", in this mode devfee mining will be on Expanse too and DAG won't be recreated at all.
	If you mine ETC on some pool that does not accept wallet address but requires Username.Worker instead, the best way is to specify "etc", in this mode devfee mining will be on ETC pools and DAG won't be recreated at all.

-etht	Time period between Ethereum HTTP requests for new job in solo mode, in milliseconds. Default value is 200ms.

-erate	send Ethereum hashrate to pool. Default value is "1", set "0" if you don't want to send hashrate.

-estale	send Ethereum stale shares to pool, it can increase effective hashrate a bit. Default value is "1", set "0" if you don't want to send stale shares.

-di 	GPU indexes, default is all available GPUs. For example, if you have four GPUs "02" will enable only first and third GPUs (#0 and #2).
	You can also turn on/off cards in runtime with "0"..."9" keys and check current statistics with "s" key.
	For systems with more than 10 GPUs: use letters to specify indexes more than 9, for example, "a" means index 10, "b" means index 11, etc.

-gser	this setting can improve stability on multi-GPU systems if miner hangs during startup. It serializes GPUs initalization routines. Use "1" to serailize some of routines and "2" to serialize all routines.
	Default value is "0" (no serialization, fast initialization).

-mode	Select mining mode:
	"0" (default) means dual Ethereum + Decred/Siacoin/Lbry mining mode.
	"1" means Ethereum-only mining mode. You can set this mode for every card individually, for example, "1-02" will set mode "1" for first and third GPUs (#0 and #2).
	For systems with more than 10 GPUs: use letters to specify indexes more than 9, for example, "a" means index 10, "b" means index 11, etc.

-ftime	failover main pool switch time, in minutes, see "Failover" section below. Default value is 30 minutes, set zero if there is no main pool.

-wd 	watchdog option. Default value is "1", it enables watchdog, miner will be closed (or restarted, see "restart" option) if any thread is not responding for 1 minute or OpenCL call failed.
	Specify "0" to disable watchdog.

-r	Restart miner mode. "0" (default) - restart miner if something wrong with GPU. "-1" - disable automatic restarting. restart >20 - restart miner if something 
	wrong with GPU or by timer. For example, "60" - restart miner every hour or when some GPU failed.
	"1" closes miner and execute "reboot.bat" file ("reboot.bash" or "reboot.sh" for Linux version) in the miner directory (if exists) if some GPU failed. 
	So you can create "reboot.bat" file and perform some actions, for example, reboot system if you put this line there: "shutdown /r /t 5 /f".

-minspeed	minimal speed for ETH, in MH/s. If miner cannot reach this speed for 5 minutes for any reason, miner will be restarted (or "reboot.bat" will be executed if "reastart 1" is set). Default value is 0 (feature disabled).

-retrydelay	delay, in seconds, between connection attempts. Default values is "20". Specify "-1" if you don't need reconnection, in this mode miner will exit if connection is lost.


-nofee	set "1" to cancel my developer fee at all. In this mode some optimizations are disabled so mining speed will be slower by about 4%. 
	By enabling this mode, I will lose 100% of my earnings, you will lose only 2-3% of your earnings.
	So you have a choice: "fastest miner" or "completely free miner but a bit slower".
	If you want both "fastest" and "completely free" you should find some other miner that meets your requirements, just don't use this miner instead of claiming that I need 
	to cancel/reduce developer fee, saying that 1-2% developer fee is too much for this miner and so on.

-li	low intensity mode. Reduces mining intensity, useful if your cards are overheated. Note that mining speed is reduced too. 
	More value means less heat and mining speed, for example, "10" is less heat and mining speed than "1". You can also specify values for every card, for example "3,10,50".
	Default value is "0" - no low intensity mode.

-lidag	low intensity mode for DAG generation, it can help with OC or weak PSU. Supported values are 0, 1, 2, 3, more value means lower intensity. Example: "1".
	You can also specify values for every card, for example "1,0,3". Default value is "0" (no low intensity for DAG generation).

-ejobtimeout	job timeout for ETH, in minutes. If miner does not get new jobs for this time, it will disconnect from pool. Default value is 10.

-tt	set target GPU temperature. For example, "80" means 80C temperature. You can also specify values for every card, for example "70,80,75".
	You can also set static fan speed if you specify negative values, for example "-50" sets 50% fan speed. Specify zero to disable control and hide GPU statistics.
	"1" (default) does not manage fans but shows GPU temperature and fan status every 30 seconds. Specify values 2..5 if it is too often.
	Note: for NVIDIA cards only temperature monitoring is supported, temperature management is not supported.
	Note: for Linux gpu-pro drivers, miner must have root access to manage fans, otherwise only monitoring will be available.

-ttli	reduce entire mining intensity (for all coins) automatically if GPU temperature is above specified value. For example, "80" reduces mining intensity if GPU temperature is above 80C.
	You can see if intensity was reduced in detailed statistics ("s" key).
	You can also specify values for every card, for example "80,85,80". You also should specify non-zero value for "target GPU temperature" option to enable this option.
	It is a good idea to set "-ttli" value higher than "-tt" value by 3-5C.

-tstop	set stop GPU temperature, miner will stop mining if GPU reaches specified temperature. For example, "-tstop 95" means 95C temperature. You can also specify values for every card, for example "-tstop 95,85,90".
	This feature is disabled by default ("0"). You also should specify non-zero value for "target GPU temperature" option to enable this option.
	If it turned off wrong card, it will close miner in 30 seconds.
	You can also specify negative value to close miner immediately instead of stopping GPU, for example, "-95" will close miner as soon as any GPU reach 95C temperature.

-fanmax	set maximal fan speed, in percents, for example, "80" will set maximal fans speed to 80%. You can also specify values for every card, for example "-fanmax 50,60,70".
	This option works only if miner manages cooling, i.e. when "target GPU temperature" option is used to specify target temperature. Default value is "100".
	Note: for NVIDIA cards this option is not supported.

-fanmin	set minimal fan speed, in percents, for example, "50" will set minimal fans speed to 50%. You can also specify values for every card, for example "50,60,70".
	This option works only if miner manages cooling, i.e. when "-tt" option is used to specify target temperature. Default value is "0".
	Note: for NVIDIA cards this option is not supported.

-cclock	set target GPU core clock speed, in MHz. If not specified or zero, miner will not change current clock speed. You can also specify values for every card, for example "1000,1050,1100,0".
	Note: for some drivers versions AMD blocked underclocking for some reason, you can overclock only.
	Note: this option changes clocks for all power states, so check voltage for all power states in WattMan or use -cvddc option.  
	By default, low power states have low voltage, setting high GPU clock for low power states without increasing voltage can cause driver crash.
	Note: for NVIDIA cards this option is not supported.

-mclock	set target GPU memory clock speed, in MHz. If not specified or zero, miner will not change current clock speed. You can also specify values for every card, for example "1200,1250,1200,0".
	Note: for some drivers versions AMD blocked underclocking for some reason, you can overclock only.
	Note: for NVIDIA cards this option is not supported.

-powlim set power limit, from -50 to 50. If not specified, miner will not change power limit. You can also specify values for every card, for example "20,-20,0,10".
	Note: for NVIDIA cards this option is not supported.

-cvddc	set target GPU core voltage, multiplied by 1000. For example, "1050" means 1.05V. You can also specify values for every card, for example "900,950,1000,970". Supports latest AMD 4xx cards only in Windows.
	Note: for NVIDIA cards this option is not supported.

-mvddc	set target GPU memory voltage, multiplied by 1000. For example, "1050" means 1.05V. You can also specify values for every card, for example "900,950,1000,970". Supports latest AMD 4xx cards only in Windows.
	Note: for NVIDIA cards this option is not supported.

-altnum	alternative GPU indexing. This option does not change GPU order, but just changes GPU indexes that miner displays, it can be useful in some cases. Possible values are:
	0: default GPU indexing. For example, if you specify "-di 05" to select first and last GPUs of six GPUs installed, miner will display these two selected cards as "GPU0" and "GPU1".
	1: same as "0", but start indexes from one instead of zero. For example, if you specify "-di 05" to select first and last GPUs of six GPUs installed, miner will display these two selected cards as "GPU1" and "GPU2".
	2: alternative GPU indexing. For example, if you specify "-di 05" to select first and last GPUs of six GPUs installed, miner will display these two selected cards as "GPU0" and "GPU5".
	3: same as "2", but start indexes from one instead of zero. For example, if you specify "-di 05" to select first and last GPUs of six GPUs installed, miner will display these two selected cards as "GPU1" and "GPU6".
	Default value is "0".

-platform	selects GPUs manufacturer. 1 - use AMD GPUs only. 2 - use NVIDIA GPUs only. 3 - use both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Default value is "3".
